💕 Will You Be My Valentine? 💕

A playful, animated Valentine’s Day webpage made with love, chaos, and a very mischievous No 🙈 button.

This project is a fun little web experience designed to ask one very important question — with floating hearts, sparkles, confetti, and a button that refuses to be clicked 😄

----------------------

🌸 What’s inside?

✨ Beautiful animated gradients
💖 Floating hearts & emojis
🎉 Confetti celebration on “Yes”
🙈 A teasing No button that runs away
🎀 Cute typography and animations
❤️ Lots of love

----------------------

🖱️ How it works

Click Yes 💕 → instant celebration 🎊

Try to click No 🙈 → good luck catching it 😜

Hearts float, sparkles shine, and the page does its thing
